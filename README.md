# Introduction

This repository introduces DITING, the first comprehensive evaluation framework for web novel translation. It leverages multi-agent reasoning, fine-grained metrics, and expert-aligned datasets to evaluate translation quality beyond surface similarity. By integrating human expertise with LLM-based evaluators, DITING establishes a new benchmark for assessing creative and culturally faithful web novel translation performance.

# Dataset

## DITING corpus

Starting from billions of chapter-level Chinese‚ÄìEnglish bilingual passages collected from online platforms, we segment and align them into high-quality sentence pairs by dis cussing with experts. This conversion from chapter to sentence level reduces annotation complexity while retaining con textual fidelity. Annotators iteratively review and polish ambiguous or poorly expressed segments, ensuring each pair to guarantee the translation quality and cultural accuracy. Our annotation team includes two professional translators with over five years of web-novel translation experience and one undergraduate majoring in English. Through continuous expert discussion, the refined data are categorized by our annotators into six dimensionsÔºö Idiom Translation„ÄÅLexical Ambiguity„ÄÅTerminology Localization„ÄÅTense Consistency„ÄÅZero Pronoun Translation„ÄÅCultural Safety. This yields 18,745 expert curated Chinese‚ÄìEnglish pairs covering idiomatic, lexical, terminological, temporal, referential, and cultural-safety phenomena.

|        Dimension         | Total |
| :----------------------: | :---: |
|    Idiom Translation     | 2,844 |
|    Lexical Ambiguity     | 4,576 |
| Terminology Localization | 1,836 |
|    Tense Consistency     | 4,982 |
| Zero Pronoun Translation | 4,407 |
|     Cultural Safety      |  100  |

## MetricAlign

To assess how closely automatic metrics align with expert judgment, we construct MetricAlign, the first meta-evaluation dataset featuring exhaustive expert annotations across diverse linguistic and cultural translation phenomena. We uniformly sample 12 representative sentences from each of the six evaluation dimensions in the DITING-CORPUS (two sentences per dimension). Each source sentence is translated by 25 LLMs, covering both open-source and proprietary systems, including multilingual and machine-translation‚Äìspecific models. The resulting dataset comprises 300 Chinese‚ÄìEnglish sentence pairs, providing comprehensive coverage of translation challenges across idiomaticity, ambiguity, terminology, tense, referentiality, and cultural safety. All translations were evaluated by the same three domain experts under a rigorously defined annotation protocol.
